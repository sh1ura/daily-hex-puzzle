## There are three versions with different difficulty levels
* **61 cells** : difficult version with cells of months, dates and days of the week. There are blank cells to fill the board.
* **43 cells** : relatively easier, smaller version with 43 cells of months and dates. No blank cells.
* **43 cells ver.2** : less symmetry (= more independent filling patterns), the easiest version.

All you need is common 3D printers (you do not need multi-material printers).

If the part does not fit into the build table of your printer, you can shrink them a bit.

**note : If you use "piece43.stl" for "board43-ver2.stl", there are some unsolvable days. Please use "piece43-ver2.stl" for "board43-ver2.stl". (Contrary, you can use "piece43-ver2.stl" for "board43.stl".)**

## Printing tips

To give a different color to the texts and grid lines, use "Pause at height" function of Cura slicer (see the picture below) to switch the material during 3D print. Change the material at height=1.5mm (larger version) or height=1.1mm (smaller version).
