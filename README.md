# Daily Hexagonal Puzzle and its solver

A hexagonal grid puzzle like the genius [A Puzzle A Day](https://www.dragonfjord.com/product/a-puzzle-a-day/). 

* You can enjoy the puzzle every day.
* Using the solver program, I confirmed there is at least one solution for every case.
* The smaller versions (43cells ver.1 and ver.2) can be solved without flipping pieces.
